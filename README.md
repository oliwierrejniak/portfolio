# Portfolio Website - 11ty experiment
⚠️ **This project has been discontinued** - I pivoted to a simpler approach.


## Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Eleventy, Vite

## What happened:
I started building my portfolio website using 11ty and Vite with the goal of creating blog-style website with post for each project generated by markdown files and 11ty templates.

After 4 months of work, I realized the stack was overengineered for simple portfolio website.

## Lessons Learned:
- Generating pages by generator like 11ty
- Simple configuration of Vite
- Generating posts by 11ty templates and Markdown files
- **Most important** Recognizing when stack is overkill
